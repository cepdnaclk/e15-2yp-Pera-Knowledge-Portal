   "description":"Our project aims to create a database of Research papers, Project Reports, Thesisâ€™ done in University of Peradeniya. Since there is no current database where we keep the project reports other than the hard copies themselves, it is not possible for a person outside the university to access these reports. We created a platform where anyone in the university can upload their respective reports into a database which can be used by anyone; inside or outside the university, to access and read through",
